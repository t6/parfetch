= _Parfetch_

Fetch FreeBSD ports with parallel connection support and
connection pipelining.

CAUTION: This is an experiment. Use at your own risk.

This is a glue application between libcurl and the ports
framework. libcurl does all the heavy lifting. It can be
activated by enabling an overlay. It replaces the default
`do-fetch` and `checksum` targets.

A statically linked binary is available in the overlay to make it
easy to use with Poudriere(-devel) as well.

== Why?

The ports framework does not make use of modern features like
HTTP pipelining. All `USES=cargo` ports fetch most distfiles from
a single host (https://crates.io) so could benefit greatly from
it. Ports with hundreds of distfiles call `fetch(1)` hundreds of
times and will open hundreds of connections one after the other.

As an example here is a basic time comparison for `devel/tokei`
where instead of opening >150 connections to https://crates.io
sequentially, it just opens 1 connection to it and can fetch all
crates basically immediately.

Even ports like `x11-toolkits/wlroots` with only a handful of
distfiles can benefit from it.

== Configure _Parfetch_

=== Build
[source]
$ ./configure && ninja

=== Install
[source]
$ ninja install

=== Local ports setup

Enable the overlay in `/etc/make.conf`:
[source]
OVERLAYS+=	/usr/local/share/parfetch/overlay

=== Poudriere setup

WARNING: This requires a Poudriere version with overlay support.
For example `poudriere-devel`.

==== Enable

Make the overlay available to Poudriere:
[source]
$ poudriere ports -c -p parfetch -m null -M /usr/local/share/parfetch/overlay

==== Usage

Build `devel/tokei` and use _Parfetch_ to fetch distfiles:
[source]
$ poudriere bulk -O parfetch devel/tokei

=== _Parfetch_ options

Options can be set in `make.conf`.

==== PARFETCH_MAKESUM_EPHEMERAL

When defined during makesum, distinfo is created/updated but
no distfiles are saved to disk. Note that the files are still
downloaded completely to checksum them but DISTDIR is left
untouched.

==== PARFETCH_MAKESUM_KEEP_TIMESTAMP

When defined during makesum, retain the previous TIMESTAMP in
distinfo. This can be useful when refreshing patches that have
no code changes and thus do not warrant a TIMESTAMP bump.

==== PARFETCH_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS

This sets the maximum number of simultaneous open connections to
a single host.

Default is 1.

==== PARFETCH_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS

This sets the global connection limit. _Parfetch_ will not use
more than this number of connections.

Default is 4.
